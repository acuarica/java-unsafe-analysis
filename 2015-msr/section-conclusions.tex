Although the current use of \smu{} seems low in SourceForge, it is important to notice the snapshot is from September 2013.
It would be interesting to apply the same analysis but to the current GitHub source code database.
Unfortunately at the moment we could not find any full dataset from GuitHub.

We strongly believe that this study will help us to develop our language.
