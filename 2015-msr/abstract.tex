The Java language and Java Virtual Machine (JVM) evolved over time to satisfy the needs for millons of developers worldwide.
Performance is one of the main drivers why the Java language changed.
One of this changes is the addition of an undocumented class, \smu{}, provided by Oracle.
Although \smu{} allows the developer to access low-level programming features, its use is extremely dangerous.
In some cases, its use can lead to a crash of the JVM.

In this paper, we study how effectively this API is used in industry.
To carry out our study, we mine ultra-large-scale software repositories and the StackOverflow database.
The goal of our study is to answer the following question: Why and how the Unsafe API is used in Java projects?

Our aim is to devise safer alternatives to \smu{} on the JVM to improve programmer productivity.
