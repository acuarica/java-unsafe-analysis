Performance is the main reason for Unsafe.

Trend using unsafe methods. But what for? Certainly you can do everithing without Unsafe API, so why using it? The key is performance.

We searched for Boa \cite{Dyer-Nguyen-Rajan-Nguyen-13}


GHTorrent \cite{Gousi13} provide GitHub quering but for metadata, not source code mining, true?

Stackoverflow mining.

Measure error with boa.

\subsection{Reflection}

\begin{verbatim}
Class<?> unsafeClass = Class.forName("sun.misc.Unsafe");
Field unsafeField = unsafeClass.getDeclaredField("theUnsafe");
unsafeField.setAccessible(true);
Object unsafe = unsafeField.get(null);
int addressSize = ((Number) unsafeClass.getMethod("addressSize").invoke(unsafe)).intValue();
\end{verbatim}

What happens with other uses such as reflection? It is not detected but it uses Unsafe. There should be a way to measure this kind of use.

Mine github, maybe parsing html.

Look for problematic uses of the API, and some use patterns.
