The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) executes Java bytecode and provides other
services for programs written in Java, Scala, Clojure, and many other
languages. Although the JVM was designed to be portable, ``write once run
anywhere'', many JVM implementations in wide use expose an API to allow access
to low-level, non-portable features of the JVM.
This API is provided through an
undocumented~\footnote{\url{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/faq-sun-packages-142232.html}}
class, \smu{}, in the Java reference implementation produced by Oracle.
The class allows the developer to access low-level programming features.
It is the equivalent to \texttt{unsafe}~\footnote{\url{http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/en-en/library/chfa2zb8(v=vs.90).aspx}} in C\#.

There is a trend in the late years to use \smu{}.
The main reason to use \smu{} is \emph{performance}.
\smu{} provides methods to allow the programmer to access otherwise impossible low-level details.
For instance, \smu{} contains methods to do compare-and-swap (CAS) operations,
needed to implement lock-free data structures.

The operations \smu{} provides can be dangerous. If misused they
can cause 
performance problems, resource leaks, deadlock, data corruption,
and even VM crashes. 

Because of the danger of using \smu{}, we aim to study how the API is used
in practice, with the longer term goal of helping to provide safer
alternatives
to \smu{}.

Sandoz~\cite{psandoz14} describe several usage patterns of \smu{}. Let's show of these examples.

Sandoz~\cite{psandoz14} did a survey to study how Unsafe is used~\footnote{\url{http://www.infoq.com/news/2014/02/Unsafe-Survey}}.

We took one step further and analyse how \smu{} is used in BOA. Moreover, we want to study how effectively people is discussing with respect to \smu{}, to that end, we analyse the Stackoverflow database.

Our research goal is to find 
Similar \cite{Dyer-Rajan-Nguyen-Nguyen-14}

Trend using unsafe methods. But what for? Certainly you can do everithing without Unsafe API, so why using it?

Overall, the main contributions of this paper are two-fold:
\begin{itemize}
\item We present a detailed study of how the Java \smu{} API is used and
\item We constrast this information on why this API is used based on responses from Stackoverflow.
\end{itemize}

The rest of this paper is organized as follows:
Section \ref{sec:relatedwork} presents related work.
Section \ref{sec:methodology} explains the methodology and technologies used to get our results.
Section \ref{sec:results} shows the results we obtained and Section \ref{sec:conclusions} concludes.
