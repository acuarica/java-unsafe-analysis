\smu{} is an undocumented~\footnote{\url{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/faq-sun-packages-142232.html}} class provided by Oracle.
It allows the developer to access low-level programming features.
It is the equivalent to \texttt{unsafe}~\footnote{\url{http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/en-en/library/chfa2zb8(v=vs.90).aspx}} in C\#.

There is a trend in the late years to use \smu{}.
The main reason to use \smu{} is \emph{performance}.
Because \smu{} provides groups of methods to allow the programmer to access otherwise impossible low-level access.

Our research goal is to find 

Trend using unsafe methods. But what for? Certainly you can do everithing without Unsafe API, so why using it? The key is performance.

We searched for Boa \cite{Dyer-Nguyen-Rajan-Nguyen-13}

 discouraged.

Stackoverflow mining.

Measure error with boa.

\subsection{Reflection}

%\begin{verbatim}
%Class<?> unsafeClass = Class.forName("sun.misc.Unsafe");
%Field unsafeField = unsafeClass.getDeclaredField("theUnsafe");
%unsafeField.setAccessible(true);
%Object unsafe = unsafeField.get(null);
%int addressSize = ((Number) %unsafeClass.getMethod("addressSize").invoke(unsafe)).intValue();
%\end{verbatim}

What happens with other uses such as reflection? It is not detected but it uses Unsafe. There should be a way to measure this kind of use.

Mine github, maybe parsing html.

Look for problematic uses of the API, and some use patterns.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows:
Section \ref{sec:relatedwork} presents related work.
In Section \ref{fig:} we show how to use the JNIF API.
Section 4 describes the design of JNIF.
Section 5 explains how we validated JNIF.
Section 6 evaluates JNIFâ€™s performance against the mainstream bytecode manipulator, ASM.
Section 7 discusses limitations, and Section \ref{sec:conclusions} concludes.
