Around 50k Java projects were mined using the Boa infrastructure.
Of those projects, 49 are using \smu{} (representing 0.1\%).
This result is even less than the estimation made by Sandoz~\cite{psandoz14}.
An overview of the projects using \smu{} is presented in table~\ref{table:projects}

The most called is \texttt{objectFieldOffset}. Because the result is then used by many other calls to Unsafe.
