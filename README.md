Oracle (Paul Sandoz) did a survey (316 responses).
We should look at it, and complement:

C# with unsafe block
====================

- http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/y31yhkeb.aspx

Structs/value types
"A pointer cannot point to a reference or to a struct that contains references,
because an object reference can be garbage collected even if a pointer is 
pointing to it. The garbage collector does not keep track of whether an 
object is being pointed to by any pointer types."

- stackalloc, fixed, unsafe, valuetypes/structs in C#

* Communicate across JVM boundary
- Platform invoke



* Sample 
  - org.jocl
  - bridj

  - Typestate in java for larval objects
  - Comment of Niko Matsakis, Rust:
I just want to drop a note to my research on Intervals.
It allows support for "temporarily mutable" objects like the larval objects you refer
 to, but using a rather different approach than Type State.
The basic idea is that users can denote the span of time in which the object is
mutable as part of its type. Once that span of time has expired, 
the object can no longer be changed.
One nice feature of this approach is that aliasing is no problem,
as the type of the object never changes --- instead,
the compiler is aware of whether a particular method occurs during the mutable span 
or not, and so the permitted operations change depending on when a method will execute.
Some more details are available here:
http://harmonic-lang.org/news/larval-objects-using-interv.html or in our recent paper:
